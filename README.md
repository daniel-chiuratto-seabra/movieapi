Movie API
=========

## Description
This project is a result of the Backbase assessment process, where the following requirement has been asked:

`Overview`

`The application should Indicate whether a movie won a “Best Picture” Oscar, given a movie’s title based on this API and this CSV file that
contains winners from 1927 until 2010. It should also allow users to give a rating to movies and provide a list of 10 top-rated movies ordered by
box office value.`

`Solution`

`The code and the deliverables should be production-ready
Here you have the Backbase stack: https://stackshare.io/backbase/backbase our services are built mainly using Java 11 (updating to
17), Spring, Hibernate and Maven. Your solution HAS TO be written in a supported version of java. You are free to use any or none
other frameworks if you like; we will review the proper use of any framework or library included.`

So, taking those definitions into account, we have, as requested, the following documentation files inside the `docs` folder:

* **solution.md** – a short (min two lines, max half a page) description of the solution and explaining some design decisions

* **how_to_run.md** - a short explanation about how to run the solution with all the needed parts

* **how_to_test.md** file explaining what needs to be done to use the service.

* **to_do.md** - to-do list with things you would add if you have more time or explaining what is missing and why etc

* **assumptions.md** – your assumptions when solving the challenge
scale.md – a description of how it will scale when the number of users/agents/consumers grows from 100 per day to 10000000 per day,
and what changes would have to be made to keep the same quality of service
